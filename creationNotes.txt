Guess the Number Process Mapping

/***the game is first called with `node index.js`= start
/***Computer asks human to pick limit = pickHighNum
/***Human picks limit = pickMaxNum
	/***convert to int = highNum
/***Computer asks human to pick number = pickMysteryNum
/***Human picks number
	/***parseInt;
  >>> 	compare mysteryNum to highNum and minNum  <<<<
/***Number saved in memory bank elsewhere = mysteryNum
/***computer picks random number within limit = numMath
/***human answers with a yes/no = pivotNum
	/***=== "n" OR (||) === "N"
/***computer analyzes response as true/false
	/***if true, asks higher/lower (unless it is the correct #!) = highLow
	/***if false, re-prompts
/***human answers with higher/lower = flipCoin
/***computer analyzes response as true/false
	/***if true, computer guesses new number
	/***if false, re-prompts
/***(repeat until computer comes to correct number and human acknowledges)
/***victory console log (total # tries)



~~possible processes required
async await, readline (process.stdin/out) & (function ask)
conditionals for true/false analysis
selected number must be compared with numberChosen (first == or !=, second > or <)
Math.randomfloor (idk if that's right)


REVERSE GAME
Computer prompts human to select computer guesser or computer picker - if guesser, cycle to above - if picker, continue below
Computer selects a random number
Computer asks human to guess the number
Computer will analyze humanResponse == or != to computerSelectedNumber
	If ==, Print response & Victory message
	If !=, computer will analyze > or <, then print both responses and prompt human for another guess (loop until ==)
